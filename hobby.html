			<h2>Riddles</h2>
			I enjoy solving riddles in my free time. Here are some of my favorites:
			<ul>
				<li>(Medium) You are stuck on an island with 199 other people, so 200 people in total. 100 have blue eyes and 100 have brown eyes but you don't know that. So you either see 99 blue eyes and 100 brown or 99 brown and a 100 blue. No one is allowed to comunicate or figure out there eye color directly (i.e mirror or reflect or asking someone...). Now every night a boat comes and will bring back anyone that is sure of their eye color. The first day a guru says: "I see someone with blue eyes". How will you figure out your eye color? Assume everyone in the island is as smart as you ;)</li>
				<li>(Medium) You have two ropes that both burn in 1 hour and those ropes do not burn uniformly. Figure out a way to use the ropes and the burner to measure 45 min.</li>
				<li>(Very hard) You are a hunter and want to kill a frog. There is an infinite amount of bushing in each direction. The frog is hidden one of the bushes. You have gun that has unlimited cartages. If you shoot a bush with the frog inside you will see blood. If you miss the frog, he will jump a fixed amount of step in one a fixed direction. If you miss again the frog jumps again the same amount in the same direction. You don't see the frog jump or where he lands. Find a way to kill the frog for sure.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Pick up lines</h2>
			For fun, with Koi McArthur we created some physics pickuplines:
			<ul>
				<li>Are you a massless spin 1 boson with color charge because I am feeling a strong interaction.</li>
				<li>We're like poles of a magnet. We don't exist alone in nature</li>
				<li>Hey girl I'd choose your curvature over general relativity any day</li>
				<li>I don't know the spring constant for my bed, want to take some data?</li>
				<li>Do you have an integer spin? Because I'd like to occupy the same states as you</li>
				<li>Looking at you emits my characteristic photons</li>
				<li>We're like imaginary complex conjugates, only togheter is our relationship real</li>
				<li>My love for you is like entropy. It's never decreasing</li>
			</ul>

				<h3>Spagetti alla carbonara</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>350g of spaghetti</li>
					<li>40g + as much as you want of pecorino romano</li>
					<li>20 g parmesean</li>
					<li>2 egg yolk</li>
					<li>120g guanciale</li>
					<li>salt, pepper</li>
				</ul>
				Steps:
				<ol>
					<li>Start boiling the water</li>
					<li>Cut the guanciale into rectangular parallelepiped of 0.5x0.5x3 cm^3. Start cooking at low heat</li>
					<li>Grate the pecorino and the parmesan and mix it with the egg yolks and 5cL or water. Mix until it becomes creamy. Salt and pepper.</li>
					<li>When the water is boiling, throw salt into it and boil the spaghetti. Brown the guanciale until they become crisp. Try to get the guanciale and the spaghetti ready together.</li>
					<li>Drain the pasta and keep a little cooking water. Put it all in a glass bowl and put the guanciale directly onto it. Mix well. Then pour the mixture of egg in the boil and stir so it hardens slighlty without getting scrambled.</li>
					<li>Serve in a plate and add pecorino and pepper.</li>
				</ol>
