			<h2>Riddles</h2>
			I enjoy solving riddles in my free time. Here are some of my favorites:
			<ul>
				<li>(Easy) There are two doors one that goes to heaven and one that goes to hell and you are allowed to ask only one question to a person. That person will either always tell the truth or will always lie. What question should you ask to be sure to go to heaven. (Hint: This riddle can be formulated like Russell's Paradox)
				<li>(Medium) You are stuck on an island with 199 other people, so 200 people in total. 100 have blue eyes and 100 have brown eyes but you don't know that. So you either see 99 blue eyes and 100 brown or 99 brown and a 100 blue. No one is allowed to comunicate or figure out there eye color directly (i.e mirror or reflect or asking someone...). Now every night a boat comes and will bring back anyone that is sure of their eye color. The first day a guru says: "I see someone with blue eyes". How will you figure out your eye color? Assume everyone in the island is as smart as you ;)</li>
				<li>(Medium) You have two ropes that both burn in 1 hour and those ropes do not burn uniformly. Figure out a way to use the ropes and the burner to measure 45 min.</li>
				<li>(Hard) You are a hunter and want to kill a frog. There is an infinite amount of bushing in each direction. The frog is hidden one of the bushes. You have gun that has unlimited cartages. If you shoot a bush with the frog inside you will see blood. If you miss the frog, he will jump a fixed amount of step in one a fixed direction. If you miss again the frog jumps again the same amount in the same direction. You don't see the frog jump or where he lands. Find a way to kill the frog for sure.</li>
			</ul>
