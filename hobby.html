			<h2>Pick up lines</h2>
			For fun, with Koi McArthur we created some physics pickuplines:
			<ul>
				<li>Are you a massless spin 1 boson with color charge because I am feeling a strong interaction.</li>
				<li>We're like poles of a magnet. We don't exist alone in nature</li>
				<li>Hey girl I'd choose your curvature over general relativity any day</li>
				<li>I don't know the spring constant for my bed, want to take some data?</li>
				<li>Do you have an integer spin? Because I'd like to occupy the same states as you</li>
				<li>Looking at you emits my characteristic photons</li>
				<li>We're like imaginary complex conjugates, only togheter is our relationship real</li>
				<li>My love for you is like entropy. It's never decreasing</li>
			</ul>

				<h3>Spagetti alla carbonara</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>350g of spaghetti</li>
					<li>40g + as much as you want of pecorino romano</li>
					<li>20 g parmesean</li>
					<li>2 egg yolk</li>
					<li>120g guanciale</li>
					<li>salt, pepper</li>
				</ul>
				Steps:
				<ol>
					<li>Start boiling the water</li>
					<li>Cut the guanciale into rectangular parallelepiped of 0.5x0.5x3 cm^3. Start cooking at low heat</li>
					<li>Grate the pecorino and the parmesan and mix it with the egg yolks and 5cL or water. Mix until it becomes creamy. Salt and pepper.</li>
					<li>When the water is boiling, throw salt into it and boil the spaghetti. Brown the guanciale until they become crisp. Try to get the guanciale and the spaghetti ready together.</li>
					<li>Drain the pasta and keep a little cooking water. Put it all in a glass bowl and put the guanciale directly onto it. Mix well. Then pour the mixture of egg in the boil and stir so it hardens slighlty without getting scrambled.</li>
					<li>Serve in a plate and add pecorino and pepper.</li>
