			<p>
			My name is Paul McKarris and I am a Universiy of Waterloo undergraduate science student in physics and mathematics.<br>
			My main intrests are food, sport, physics, mathematics and philosophy. I enjoy cooking and trying new food. I also play basketball every other day.<br><br>

			In physics, I am mostly interested in foundational question like why do we choose certain postulates, why are certain mathematical structure use, is any language good to describe our world, what are the experimental reasons, what are the extra assumptions that do not come from experiments, can we test them, how much do our current experimental methods tells us about the laws...<br><br>


			In mathematics, I am currently intressted in logic, model theory and category theory.<br><br>

			In Philosphy, I am mostly interessted in philosphy of language, logic and its reltion to epistemology. I thrive for rigurous argumentations, this can been seen in an essay I have wrote to participate at a essay contest organised by the <a href="https://fqxi.org/" target="_blank">Foundational Quesitons Institute</a> and can be found <a href="https://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/3512" target="_blank">here</a>. I am also interested in metaphysics, especially in the philosophy of the mind where I learn toward the thesis about the <a href= "https://philpapers.org/archive/KAMTIO-4.pdf" target= "_blank"> illusion of conscious experience</a>.
