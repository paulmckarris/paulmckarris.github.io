			<p>
			My name is Paul McKarris and I am a Universiy of Waterloo Undergraduate Science Student in Physics and Mathematics.<br>
			My main intrests are food, sport, physics and mathematics. I enjoy cooking and trying new food. I also play basketball every other day.<br>
			In physics, I am mostly interested in foundational question like why do we choose certain postulates, why are certain mathematical structure use, is any language good to describe our world, what are the experimental reasons, what are the extra assumptions that do not come from experiments, can we test them, how much do our current experimental methods tells us about the laws... All those type of questions are what I think and work the most on. I really believe in rigour to formulate physics and here is a quote that illustrates that:

			<blockquote>"What we cannot speak about (clearly) we must pass over in silence."
				<footer>â€”Ludwig Wittgenstein, <cite>Tractatus Pears/McGuinness translation</cite></footer>
			</blockquote>
			
			In mathematics, I am currently intressted in logic and category theory. I also enjoy analysis. I recently discovered Nicolas Bourbaki's Elements of Mathematics and I found them amazing. It is the only books I found that builds mathematics from ground using Logic + ZFC.
