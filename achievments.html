			<h2>2019 CERN Summer Student Programme</h2>
			This summer I got selected to <a href="https://home.cern/summer-student-programme" target="_blank">CERN Summer Student Programme</a> where I will attending a series of lectures. I will also be working on an experiment (I don't know yet what I will be doing).

			<h2>2018 Canadian Astroparticle Physics Summer School</h2>
			In summer 2018 I got accepted to the <a href="https://mcdonaldinstitute.ca/capss-info/" target="_blank">Canadian Astroparticle Physics Summer School</a> hosted by the Arthur B. McDonald Canadian Astroparticle Physics Research Institute. During this we got lectures about:
			<ul>
				<li>Astrophysical evidence for dark matter, cosmology of dark matter, models and signals of dark matter, direction detection of dark mark matter</li>
				<li>Neutrino oscillations; the SNO experiment, neutrino mass theory and experiment, neutrinoless double-beta decay</li>
			</ul>
			We also visited the 2015 Nobel Prize winning experiement SNO+ at <a href="https://www.snolab.ca/" target="_blank">SNOLAB</a> and other experiments in SNOLAB.

			<h2>2017 CERN Beamline for Schools Competition</h2>
			In 2017, I gathered people from my highschool and participate at <a href="https://beamlineforschools.cern" target="_blank"> CERN's Beamline for Schools competition</a>. We designed a experiment to serach for frationally charged particles. We wrote a <a href="https://beamline-for-schools.web.cern.ch/sites/beamline-for-schools.web.cern.ch/files/Canada%20-%20Charging%20Cavaliers.pdf" target="_blank">proposal</a> and filmed a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckhPq1he3ow" target="_blank">video</a><br>
			We got covered by many journals for our achievements, such as, <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/06/13/high-school-students-from-cambridge-ont-win-chance-to-test-experiment-at-cern.html" target="_blank">Toronto Star</a> and <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/charging-cavaliers-cern-1.4307858" target="_blank">CBC</a>.
